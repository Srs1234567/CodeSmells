Hello. Here is my animation task. Sorry if I didn't follow the instructions as expected. I'm showing you both animations but at the same time. I am adding a gif image of my work. The reason for these changes is to avoid being copied by someone else. I even added my favorite color "Purple".

My references are the following links and some help from geeks for geeks.Â  Also I used this tool to convert my video to GIF VEED.IO.
